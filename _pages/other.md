I’m an avid reader with interests spanning machine learning, entrepreneurship, psychology, and beyond. Here are a few of them:

<ul style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.1; list-style-type: square; padding-left: 4.4em;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.2em;"><em>Attention Is All You Need (Lukasz Kaiser, 2017)</em></li>
    I deeply admire this book; not only for introducing Transformers and explaining how the Attention Mechanism works, but also for its title, which resonates far beyond the technical domain. Read the title again, and stay open to the deeper, almost universal concept it conveys.
