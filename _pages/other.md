I’m an avid reader with interests spanning machine learning, entrepreneurship, psychology, and beyond. Here are a few of them:

<ul style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.1; list-style-type: square; padding-left: 4.4em;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>Attention Is All You Need (Lukasz Kaiser, 2017)</em><br>
    I deeply admire this book; not only for introducing Transformers and explaining how the Attention Mechanism works, but also for its title, which resonates far beyond the technical domain. Read (only) the title again, and stay open to the deeper, almost universal concept it conveys.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>Think and Grow Rich (Napoleon Hill, 1937)</em><br>
    No introduction needed for this state-of-the-art! It’s Napoleon’s study of highly successful figures such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison, outlining a “Philosophy of Achievement” built around 13 core principles.
  </li>
</ul>
