I’m an avid reader with interests spanning machine learning, entrepreneurship, psychology, and beyond. Here are a few of them:

<ul style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.1; list-style-type: square; padding-left: 4.4em;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>Attention Is All You Need (Lukasz Kaiser, 2017)</em><br>
    I deeply admire this (ML) book; not only for introducing Transformers and explaining how the Attention Mechanism works, but also for a broader concept, which resonates far beyond the technical domain. Read (only) the title again, and stay open to the deeper, almost universal concept it conveys.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>Think and Grow Rich (Napoleon Hill, 1937)</em><br>
    No introduction needed for this state-of-the-art! It’s Napoleon’s study of highly successful figures such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison, outlining a “Philosophy of Achievement” built around 13 core principles.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>You Squared (Price Pritchett, 1994)</em><br>
    Don't miss this (little) book by Dr. Pritchett.
  </li>
  
</ul>
