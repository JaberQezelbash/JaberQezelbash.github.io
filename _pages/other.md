I’m an avid reader with interests spanning machine learning, entrepreneurship, psychology, and more. Here are a few books I recommend:

<ul style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.1; list-style-type: square; padding-left: 4.4em;">

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>As a Man Thinketh (James Allen, 1902)</em><br>
    I believe each person may interpret this conceptual artwork at a different level of understanding. So I encourage you to read it carefully, perhaps more than once, to fully grasp it!
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>Think and Grow Rich (Napoleon Hill, 1937)</em><br>
    No introduction needed for this state-of-the-art! It’s Napoleon’s study of highly successful figures such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison, outlining a “Philosophy of Achievement” built around 13 core principles.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>Attention Is All You Need (Ashish Vaswani, 2017)</em><br>
    This is a machine learning paper, not a book. I chose it because I deeply admire it; not only for introducing Transformers and explaining how the Attention Mechanism works, but also for a broader concept, which resonates far beyond the technical domain. Read (only) the title again, and stay open to the deeper (almost universal) concept it conveys.

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>You Squared (Price Pritchett, 1994)</em><br>
    Don't miss this (little) book by Dr. Pritchett.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;">
    <em>to be added...</em><br>
  </li>
  
</ul>
