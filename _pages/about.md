I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Florida. I am pursuing my current studies under the supervision of Dr. K. Hicklin. My research mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Optimization with applications in healthcare. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a part-time Healthcare Data Scientist for 4 years. During the same time, I was also a Lecturer at my bachelor's university.
